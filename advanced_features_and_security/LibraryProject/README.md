# Permissions and Groups Setup Guide

This Django application uses **custom permissions** and **user groups** to control access to various model actions (create, edit, view, delete).

## üîê Custom Permissions

Custom permissions are defined inside the model `Book` using the `Meta` class.

```python
class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    class Meta:
        permissions = [
            ("can_view", "Can view books"),
            ("can_create", "Can create books"),
            ("can_edit", "Can edit books"),
            ("can_delete", "Can delete books"),
        ]


# üîê Security Settings and Practices in the Project

This section documents the security measures applied to ensure the safety and privacy of user data and to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Security Configurations in `settings.py`

- `DEBUG = False`:  
  Disabled in production to avoid leaking sensitive error messages.

- `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True`:  
  Enables the browser's built-in XSS protection.

- `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'`:  
  Prevents the website from being embedded in frames, protecting against clickjacking attacks.

- `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True`:  
  Stops the browser from guessing content types, reducing risk of drive-by download attacks.

- `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True`:  
  Ensures the CSRF cookie is only sent over HTTPS, protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks.

- `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True`:  
  Forces session cookies to be sent only over HTTPS.

---

## üß± Content Security Policy (CSP)

We use a CSP header to control where scripts, styles, and other resources can be loaded from.

Example configuration:
```python
CSP_DEFAULT_SRC = ("'self'",)
CSP_SCRIPT_SRC = ("'self'", "https://trusted.cdn.com")
CSP_STYLE_SRC = ("'self'", "https://trusted.styles.com")
CSP_IMG_SRC = ("'self'", "data:", "https://images.com")


## HTTPS Configuration
- `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`: Forces HTTPS by redirecting all HTTP requests.
- `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`: Enables HSTS to force browsers to use HTTPS for 1 year.
- `SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS` & `SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD`: Extend HSTS to subdomains and allow browser preload.

## Secure Cookies
- `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` & `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE`: Ensure cookies are only sent over secure connections.

## Headers
- `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = DENY`: Prevents clickjacking.
- `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF`: Prevents MIME type sniffing.
- `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER`: Enables built-in browser XSS filters.
